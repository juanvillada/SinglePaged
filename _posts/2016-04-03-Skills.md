We **provide bioinformatics training** through both workshops and in-depth courses. 

##### 1. Workshops 

##### a. Next Generation Sequencing Introduction Series
([Galaxy-based](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/)) workshops on RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq to introduce basic concepts of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis. The goal of these workshops are to enable researchers to design their studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

##### b. Basic Bioinformatics Skills Series
Topics include R, data visualization using R, Python programming, Unix and high-performance computing (duration varies from half a day to three days).

##### 2.  In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Courses
These intensive courses run for 10-12 days and are aimed at bench biologists interested in learning how to perform independent, best practice NGS-based analyses. Topics include:

- Unix & High-Performance Computing ([Orchestra](https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/#orchestra))
- NGS data analysis (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Variant calling)
- Statistical analysis using R
- Functional analysis


*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*

### **Upcoming workshops/courses**:


* **June 2016: [In-depth NGS data analysis course](http://tinyurl.com/ngs-course-summer-2016)**: 

This 10-day in-depth course will instruct participants on the theoretical and practical concepts related to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis, enabling them to perform these analyses independently.

* **May 12th and 13th, 2016: [Introduction to UNIX and RNA-Seq data analysis](https://hms-unix-may2016.eventbrite.com)**:
 
This workshop will introduce participants to the command-line interface, compute clusters, and basic methods to perform differential gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq data.
